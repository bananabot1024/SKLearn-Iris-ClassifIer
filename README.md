# SKLearn-Iris-Classifier
Uses Python's Scikit Learn package to implement various algorithms to classify irises

Iris dataset from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

Packages:
- pandas (for data synthesis and data frames)
- matplotlib (to plot results)
- sklearn (fpr machine learning algorithms)

Program Summary:
- load dataset / print data summaries
- plot data (box and whisker, histogram, scatterplot)
- split data into 80% training and 20% testing
- tests logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, KNN, decision tree, naive bayes, and SVM algorithms
- plot algorithm comparison in a boxplot
